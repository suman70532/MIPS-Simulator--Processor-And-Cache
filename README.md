# MIPS-Simulator--Processor-And-Cache
To design a trace based cache simulator and to integrate it with the processor simulator

You will be implementing a basic cache simulator in C/C++. It will take in several parameters that describe the desired cache (e.g. size, associativity, etc.) along with a trace file describing data memory accesses for a particular program. The simulator will output several statistics (e.g. hit rate, total running time of the program, etc.)

    For the standalone simulator do the following:

        Do a full cache simulator: Details here. 

You should run your simulator using the full application traces (spice.trace, cc.trace, tex.trace) from part1 to ensure your simulator works properly.

        Evaluate four cache parameters and provide a detailed study: Details here. 

You have to submit the results of your findings in a PDF. Write up your performance evaluation as a 4-5 page report. Place your results in charts (using programs such Excel), and devote 1-2 paragraphs of text explaining your results (and answering questions) for each section.

    Integrate the above-designed cache simulator in the processor simulator.
